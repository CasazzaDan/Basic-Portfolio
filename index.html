                            <img src="assets/images/me.JPG">My name is Dan Casazza. I was born in New Jersey, and moved to Minnesota in 2012. It has been a interesting 7 years to say the least. 
                             My main focus when I moved here was to find a better career-path/lifestyle, which led me to starting my own painting LLC in 2016.
                            Although the freedom and self-accomplishment of running a business is hard to be matched, I decided it was best to find a more steady career option. 
                            Coding has been a hobby of mine for the past few years, and the when the option to work for a SalesForce Consulting company came along I knew I had to dedicate a lot more time into practicing and improving my coding knowledge.
